# Web-Dev-Movie-Data-Base-Final
This is a web dev project that required the implementation of a movie database API. It pulls the top 3 movies from the database and displays the description, name, and movie poster. Option to add tickets to the cart. Additional functionality was planned to add a purchase page for extra credit. Only partially built.
